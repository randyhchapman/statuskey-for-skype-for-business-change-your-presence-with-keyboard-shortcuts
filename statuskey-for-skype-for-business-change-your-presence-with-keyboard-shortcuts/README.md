Introducing **StatusKey for Skype for Business**.

StatusKey is a tray application that allows you to change your Lync and Skype for Business presence status using keyboard shortcuts.  I know you can set your status in the Skype for Business client itself,
 but really that just takes too many mouse clicks.  If application development is good for anything it is for time savings.  Rather than hunting for the client on the task bar full of other stuff or right clicking the (probably) hidden system tray
 icon and opening the menu to set your status, just hit the appropriate hot keys and you're set.


Lync and Skype for Business is, in part, about efficiency.  I know your status changes with your calendar or if you're in a call or even if you leave your computer alone long enough.  Now you can change
 it even faster.


**Who doesn't love a keyboard shortcut?**




I programmed 6 Keyboard Shortcuts in total. 
I've tried to make the keyboard shortcuts intuitive. 
Hopefully you get the idea.


R = Reset Status
B = Busy
A = Away
F = Free
T = Be Right Back
D = Do Not Disturb


Unzip and run the EXE to install.
